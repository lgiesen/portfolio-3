Through a <a href='/#/projects#DLCaseStudy'>case study</a>  in the advanced module 'Deep Learning with Python' and the preparation of a lecture on the introduction to machine learning, I gained insights into how artificial intelligence works, its current limitations, and possibilities. I deepened my machine learning knowledge in an <a href='/#/projects#NLP'>internship</a>, another<a href='/#/projects#ForestHeight'>case study</a> about regressing the tree heights in the German Black Forest, and my <a href='/#/projects#BA'>bachelor thesis</a> on the semantic segmentation of trees in South Africa using satellite imagery. Moreover, I touched on machine learning in further projects, such as a <a href='/#/projects#DImensaToday'>smart dining recommender system</a> and the <a href='/#/projects#AutomationOfDocumentChecks'>automation of document checks</a>.This fascination led me to choose it as a focus in my Information Systems studies. The application of these technologies in various projects not only broadened my expertise but also reinforced my passion for developing innovative solutions that address real-world problems and create genuine value.",

That is why I try to make great memories with my family and friends as often as possible. These include our annual ski trips, weekend getaways, or carnival with a group of friends and my family in Cologne.",

In addition, I was able to expand my skillset through consulting projects at <a href='https://move-ev.de/' target='_blank'>move e. V.</a>. I also completed other projects in my spare time or at the university. More insights into these and other projects can be found in my <a href='/experience'>experience overview</a>.",
    "sport": "In addition to work and my private life, I am also very ambitious in sports, as I want to push my limits in various ways: For example, I try to improve my running. Moreover, I ran a half marathon at the age of 16 and run just under 4 min/km on my 10 km route. Over the last few years, I have improved to running a half marathon in under 1h 30 min (see <a href='https://www.strava.com/athletes/17923080' target='_blank'>Strava</a>). During my school years, I played football for a decade and was able to prove myself in the district league. Currently, I only play casually with friends. Instead, I am more active in tennis, home workouts, and beach and indoor volleyball. </br>My favorite sport is skiing because I love the incredible feeling of gliding quickly through the snow and enjoying the great views. It is also fun to do off-piste tours with ascents and then ski through untouched snow. Therefore, I go skiing every year with my family to <a href='https://www.bergfex.com/lech-zuers-arlberg/' target='_blank'>Lech</a> (Austria), with friends to <a href='https://www.bergfex.com/soelden/' target='_blank'>S旦lden</a>, or with the university sports to <a href='https://www.bergfex.com/portes-du-soleil/' target='_blank'>Portes du Soleil</a> (Switzerland-France), which is always an eventful and exciting experience because you get to meet many cool people.",
